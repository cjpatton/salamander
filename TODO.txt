It looks like my new automated approach is working not too badly. I should 
write about it so I don't forget how the algorithm works. The next things
to be done are:

1.) more testing. 

2.) entrance to rathouse. Define regions of the image for which we should do 
    another pass of delta with no binary morphology. This will be useful for 
    the rathouse door. Mice tend to peak in without going inside and usually 
    do not appear in the delta image.

Trying to churn out an affective GUI, while a fantastic learning experience in
software development, turned out to be a huge waste of time. I've deleted 
all the code written for GTK. I plan on restarting from scratch using WX 
instead. 

However, the primary goal of this branch is to develop an algorithm that 
does all the video processing automatically.
