I'm now considering switching to OpenCV. It seems to be a better known image 
processing framework. It's WAY smaller and supposed to be more efficient since it's
written in pure C. ITK is primarily used for medical image processing. Plus, 
OpenCV has a tool for machine learning, which would be cool to learn. I just need to 
make sure it will give me all the functionality I need.
